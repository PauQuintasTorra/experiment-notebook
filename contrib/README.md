This folder contains copies of external, free software packages.

This enables a relatively reliable archiving mechanism in case the originally reference packages stop being available.

Please note that all packages are understood to have licenses compatible with enb's. If this is not the case, please let us know.

See the `enb/plugins/*/__plugin__.py` files for additional information on these packages.
