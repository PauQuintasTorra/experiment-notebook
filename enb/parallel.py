    On linux platforms, methods are run via ray, and the *args and **kwargs arguments are passed
    to the `@ray.remote` decorator. On other platforms, the multiprocessing library is employed.

    To run a parallel method `f`, call `f.start` with the arguments you want to pass to f.
    An id object is returned immediately. The result can then be retrieved by calling
    `enb.parallel.get` with the id object.

    Important: parallel calls should not read or modify global variables.
    The only exception is enb.config.options, which can be read from parallel calls.
