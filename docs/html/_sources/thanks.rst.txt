Thanks
======

Big thanks to all these people/projects without which `enb` would not be possible:

Core libraries
++++++++++++++

The `enb` core is firmly supported by the following key libraries:

* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
* `ray <https://docs.ray.io/>`_
* `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_

Several other are also essential: please see the requirements in `setup.py` for more details.

Special thanks to all contributors to `python <https://www.python.org/about/>`_ itself.
Without them, this library would have never been on time.

contains full reference to their respective authors, who also have enb's eternal gratitude.
