Using existing image compression codecs
---------------------------------------

The |enb| library offers a set of codecs that can be installed via the `enb plugin install` interface.
You can list the available codecs by performing a search among all available plugins::

    enb plugin list codec

And then, for instance to install the `zip` plugin one can simply run::

    enb plugin install zip installation_folder

Codec availabily
----------------

Different codecs are available for different data types and bit depths. If you want to test
all publicly available codecs, you can install the `test-codecs` plugin with::

    enb plugin install test-codecs tc

and then run the `test_all_codecs.py` script, e.g., with::

    python tc/test_all_codecs.py

It will produce a set of plots describing the codecs
and the data types for which they are available. A snapshot of this output is shown next
