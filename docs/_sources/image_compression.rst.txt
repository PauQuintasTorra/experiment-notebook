Image compression experiments
=============================

The `enb` library can be used to create many types of experiments.
Specific support is provided for image compression experiments.

This section describes how to quickly create and adapt lossless and lossy
compression experiments with existing and new codecs. Several |enb| plugins
are provided which serve as templates for your work.

The following plugins are available:

    * `lossless-compression`
    * `lossy-compression`
    * `test-codecs`

You will learn how to use and extend these templates, including
the definition of new codecs, e.g., wrappers for compression tools
you want to evaluate.
